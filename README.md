Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS): Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11.https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
√ Factors to be considered while selecting an OS:
•Compatibility with Hardware: Ensure the OS supports your computer’s hardware, including the processor, memory, and storage.
•User Interface and Ease of Use: Choose an OS with a user-friendly interface that you find intuitive and easy to navigate.
•Available Software and Applications: Consider the software you need for your projects and check if they are supported by the OS.
•Security Features: Look for an OS with robust security features to protect your data and privacy3.
Performance Requirements: Assess the performance capabilities of the OS, especially if you’re running resource-intensive applications.
• Cost:--Some Operating Systems are free while others require purchase or subscriptions.
• Support and Community:- An active community and available support can be invaluable for troubleshooting and learning.
√ Installing Windows  11:
•Check System Requirements: Verify that your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Windows 11.
•Backup Your Data: Save important files externally to avoid data loss during the installation process6.
•Create Installation Media: Download the Windows 11 installation file from Microsoft and use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.
•Change BIOS/UEFI Settings: Modify settings to boot from the USB drive.
•Install Windows 11: Boot from the USB drive and follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11.
•Complete Setup: After installation, set up your user account and preferences.

3. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code.https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
√ Installing a Text Editor or IDE:

•Downloading: Visit the official website of the text editor or IDE and download the installer for your operating system such as VS Code or Git.
•Running the Installer: Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.
•Configuration: After installation, configure the editor or IDE according to your preferences and needs.

5. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
√ Setting up Version Control System:


7. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

8. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

9. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

10. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

11. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

12. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
